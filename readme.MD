# MidTerm - Advanced Python Calculator

This project will implement a Python-based REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) calculator that will explain modern software engineering principles using plugin architecture and design patterns. This project is built using Command Pattern and a plugin-based system. This calculator will support basic arithmetic operations along with maintaining calculation history using Pandas integration. Because each activity appears as an individual command, the application's Â design allows simple functionality extension through plugins, supporting loose coupling and maintainable code. Important features include continuous integration using GitHub Actions, extensive error handling, unit testing with pytest, and durable storage of calculation history in CSV format. The solution serves as a great example of how to create software applications that are expandable, maintainable, and thoroughly tested by showing the practical application of software design principles such as environment variable configuration, strong logging, and a plugin architecture.

## Workflow Details

The CI/CD pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Runs on the latest Ubuntu environment
   - Sets up Python 3.10

2. **Dependency Installation**:
   - Upgrades pip to the latest version
   - Installs `flake8` and `pytest`
   - Installs all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (if present)

3. **Testing**:
   - Runs pytest for unit testing
   - Executes pytest with pylint for code quality checks
   - Performs test coverage analysis using pytest and coverage

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SamuelSudeepAyyala/Midterm.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Midterm
    ```

3. Checkout the `branchname` to access the latest plugin system implementation:

    ```bash
    git checkout plugins
    git checkout commands
    etc
    ```

4. Install any dependencies (if applicable).
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the main Python file:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

6. **Execute a command:**
    The program will prompt for user input. For example, to add two numbers:
    ```
    Type 'menu' to show menu
    Type 'exit' to exit 
    >>> menu
    Welcome to the Basic Calcualator.
    Select the operation to be performed
    Add
    Subtract
    Multiply
    Divide
    >>> add
    Enter two space-seperated numbers: 23 2
    Addition result: 25
    ```

## Running Tests Locally

To replicate the CI environment locally, you can run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flake8 pytest pytest-pylint pytest-cov

# Run tests
pytest
pytest --pylint
pytest --pylint --cov
```
## Usage

To run the project:
```bash
python main.py
```

## History & Data Management

The calculator maintains a history of all operations in a CSV file format. The history is stored in `data/calculator_history.csv`.


When the application is exited, it checks for the existence of a `data` folder. If the folder does not exist, it will be created automatically. The application will then prompt the user to save the calculation history. 

### Saving History

- If the user chooses to save, the history will be exported to `calculation_history.csv` within the `data` folder.
- This ensures that all calculations performed during the session are preserved for future reference.

### Example Workflow

1. **Exit Command**: When you run the `exit` command, the application will:
   - Check for the `data` folder.
   - Prompt you with a message: "Do you want to save the calculation history? (yes/no)"
   
2. **User Decision**:
   - If you respond with `yes`, the application will create the `data` folder (if it doesn't exist) and save the history to `calculation_history.csv`.
   - If you respond with `no`, the history will not be saved.
## CSV File Structure

The history is stored with the following columns:


|   Operation     |   Operand1   |   Operand2   |   Result   |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|------------|
|   Add           |   4.0        |   3.0        |   7.0      |
|   Subtract      |   4.0        |   5.0        |   -1.0     |
|   Multiplication |   5.0       |   3.0        |   15.0     |
|   Division      |   50.0       |   2.0        |   25.0     |

Each row in the CSV contains:
- **Operation**: Type of arithmetic operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
- **Operand1**: First number in the calculation
- **Operand2**: Second number in the calculation
- **Result**: Final result of the operation

The history can be saved upon exiting the calculator by selecting 'Y' when prompted.
